<h1 id="myHeader">Retirement Plan Simulator</h1>

<p> The purpose of Retirement Plan Simulator (RPS) is to pressure test the survivability of financial plans for retirement by running the following simulations:</p>

<p>1)	Baseline Simulation: RPS will simulate your retirement plan against a simple smooth annual return rates of 6% for stocks and 3% for bonds, and 2.25% inflation rate. </p>

<p>2)	Historical Simulation: RPS will simulate your retirement plan against actual prior historical market performance and sequence of events.  Annual return rates of the S&P500 index (or total stock market index when available), intermediate bond fund index and inflation rates are used in the simulation.</p>

<p> RPS cannot definitively tell if a plan will survive retirement, but it can show the possible range of results that could be experienced during retirement.  If a plan can survive every sequence of events in history (even the worst-case sequence of events), there is an excellent chance the plan will survive future scenarios.  </p>
