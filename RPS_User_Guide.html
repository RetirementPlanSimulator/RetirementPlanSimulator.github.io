<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Social
Security </span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enter the annual benefit expected from social
security. Estimated benefits are found on SSA.GOV.  I have found that SSA.GOV
estimated benefits assume working until benefits start.  So, for the
age 70 estimated benefit SSA.GOV assumes working until age 70.  
A more precise estimate can be determined by using ANYPIA32 downloaded from the SSA web site.  
  If planning to work until age 62 and taking benefits at age 70,
ANYPIA32 will provide a more accurate benefit estimate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS does not support complicated scenarios such as windfall
elimination rules and file / suspend.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Roth
Conversion</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS can look for opportunities to do a backdoor Roth
Conversion during the simulation.  If there is enough in the brokerage account to live on for 1-3
years before drawing down from the IRA, it is likely taxes will be
extremely low (if not zero).  This might be a good time to consider a Roth
conversion.  RPS will limit the taxes paid to either the 0%, 10% or 12% tax
bracket in the conversion year - depending on the option selected.  Try each and see what works best. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Annual
Budget</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This should be the amount minimally needed to live on
comfortably during retirement.  Include non-discretionary expenses such as rent, utilities,
health care, groceries, Medicare, and insurance.  Also include discretionary expenses such as travel,
hobbies and dining out.  In short, enter the amount planned to spend in a
comfortable retirement.  Do not include mortgage principal and interest in
this amount - that is entered in a separate field.  Do not allow for federal
income or capital gains taxes as RPS will estimate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enter annual budget in today's dollars - RPS will adjust for inflation.  Mortgage
is not adjusted for inflation.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS separates the budget into 4 different timeframes.  This
will allow RPS to simulate using budgets that will change throughout retirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS includes a method to consider assisted living budget during
the last 3 years of life.  Depending on state of residence, assisted living and nursing home costs
could cost at least $100,000 per year in today's dollars.  RPS assumes that assisted living costs will be incurred in the last 3 years of the plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Mortgage
Amount</span></u></b>: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enter the annual mortgage principal and interest RPS tracks this separately because it is not subject to inflation
adjustments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enter your age when the last mortgage payment is made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Stock
Allocation %</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the precentage amount of retirement assets invested in stocks.  RPS assumes the remainder will be invested in
an intermediate bond index fund.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Retirement
Bonus %</span></u>:</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a unique feature of RPS that I have not found with
other tools.  RPS will simulate taking a bonus whenever the simulated
historical ending balance for a given year is greater than the baseline plan
ending balance for the same year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, assume the baseline plan shows $900,000 for an ending balance after first year of retirement.  
    After year 1 of a simulated scenario, the ending balance is $950,000.  A Retirement Bonus of 10% will result in a $5000 bonus withdraw for that year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The idea is for RPS to look for additional opportunities to withdraw funds over and above the budget to be enjoyed during retirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Baseline
Stock and Bond Returns</span></u></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The default return rates for the baseline simulation is 6%
stock ad 3% for bonds.   These can be overridden for the simulation.  The
bonus paid out during historical simulation will be impacted by annual
baseline ending balance.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Withdrawals</span></u>
</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS will start the withdraw simulation after either you or
your spouse have retired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS will simulate drawing down assets in the following
sequence: 1) IRA RMD 2) brokerage accounts 3) IRAs non RMD 4) Roth / H.S.A.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS assumes withdrawals occur each year on January 1st.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Annual
Process</span></u></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Inflation adjustments are made starting January 1st of each year simulated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS will simulate rebalancing to preferred asset
allocation on January 1 of each year simulated . </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Roth /
HSA</span></u></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS assumes that HSA and Roth money will be the last accounts
to be withdrawn - and all money can be used tax free.  For HSA, the
assumption is medical expenses incurred will be greater than the amount
withdrawn.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Excess
RMD</span></u></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Required minimum distribution from IRA may exceed 
total need (Budget plus taxes minus social security and pensions).  In this case, RPS assumes that excess money will be deposited into the brokerage
account.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Budget
Adjustments When 1 Dies</span></u></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When testing a scenario where one person dies before the
other, RPS will automatically reduce the budget 25%.  It assumed that when one
person dies, budget needs are 25% lower.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Taxes</span></u></b>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS calculates estimated federal taxes using simple standard
deduction assumption. The reason RPS calculates taxes is to help with comparing
different retirement scenarios such as the benefits of taking social security
at various ages, and benefits of doing a Roth conversation early in retirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS only assumes 1 (filing single) or 2 exemptions (married
filing joint).  No other options are provided.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tax implications for employment wages is not considered.  RPS
does not consider itemized deductions, alternative minimum tax, or any eligible credits.
It also does not consider self-employment tax, employment
taxes or other taxes that may impact the true final federal tax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Federal Taxes are calculated and combined in with the
following year budget.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brokerage account gains are assumed to be long-term and
taxed at the capital gains tax rate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Calculations for married filing jointly and single filing
options are provided.  Head of household and married filed separately are not
included.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>State income taxes are not calculated.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Social
Security Taxable</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS uses the process defined IRS Publication 915 for
calculating the estimated Social Security Taxable Amount.  Social Security benefit amount
is federally taxable up to 85% of the benefit amount.</p>
