<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Social
Security </span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enter the annual benefit you expect to receive from social
security. Estimated benefits are found on SSA.GOV.  I have found that SSA.GOV
estimated benefits assume you will work until your benefit date.  So, for the
age 70 estimated benefit SSA.GOV assumes you will work to age 70.  You will get
a more precise estimate by using “ANYPIA32” downloaded from the SSA web site.  
    If you are planning to work until age 62 and delay benefits until age 70,
ANYPIA32 will provide a more accurate benefit estimate.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS does not support scenarios such as ‘windfall
elimination’ rules and ‘file and suspend’.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Roth
Conversion</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS can look for opportunities to do a backdoor Roth
Conversion.  If you have enough in your brokerage account to live on for 1-3
years before drawing down on your IRA, it is likely your taxes will be
extremely low (if not zero).  This might be a good time to consider a Roth
conversion.  RPS will limit the taxes you pay to either the 0%, 10% or 12% tax
bracket – depending on your selection.  Try each and see what works best.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Annual
Budget</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This should be the amount you minimally want to live on
during retirement.  Include non-discretionary expenses such as rent, utilities,
health care, groceries.  Also include discretionary expenses such as travel,
hobbies and dining out.  In short, enter the amount you plan to spend in a
comfortable retirement.  Do not include your mortgage principal and interest in
this amount - that is entered in a separate field.   Do not allow for federal
income or capital gains taxes – RPS will estimate.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Annual budget is adjusted by inflation each year.  Mortgage
is not.           </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS separates the budget into 4 different timeframes.  This
will allow you to simulate with budgets that will change throughout your
retirement.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS includes a method to consider nursing home budget during
the last 3 years of your life.  Depending on where you live, nursing home costs
could cost at least $100,000 per year.  RPS assumes that if you do want to
consider nursing home care costs, it will simulate using those costs the last 3
years of your life.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Mortgage
Amount</span></u></b>: </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enter the annual mortgage principal and interest you are
paying.  RPS tracks this separately because it is not subject to inflation
adjustments.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Enter your age when the last mortgage payment is made.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Stock
Allocation %</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is the amount of your retirement assets you feel
comfortable investing in stocks.  RPS assumes the remainder will be invested in
an intermediate bond index fund.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Retirement
Bonus %</span></u>:</b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>This is a unique feature of RPS that I have not found with
other tools.  RPS will simulate taking a bonus whenever the simulated
historical ending balance for a given year is greater than the baseline plan
ending balance for the same year.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>For example, assume your baseline plan shows you should have
$900,000 for an ending balance after first year of retirement.  Now, let’s say
after year 1 of a simulated scenario, the ending balance is $950,000.  If you
enter 10% in Retirement Bonus %, RPS will take 10% of the difference ($50,000)
and give you a $5000 bonus withdraw for that year.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The idea is for RPS to look for opportunities to withdraw
and enjoy your retirement savings if actual results are better than your baseline
plan.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Baseline
Stock and Bond Returns</span></u></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>The default return rates for the baseline simulation is 6%
stock ad 3% for bonds.  You can override this by adjusting these fields.  The
bonus paid out during historical simulation will be impacted by your annual
baseline ending balance.   </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Withdrawals</span></u>
</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS will start the withdraw simulation after either you or
your spouse have retired.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS will simulate drawing down your assets in the following
sequence: 1) IRA RMD 2) brokerage accounts 3) IRAs non RMD 4) Roth / H.S.A.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS assumes withdrawals will occur each year on January 1st.
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Annual
Process</span></u></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Inflation adjustments are made starting January 1.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS will simulate rebalancing to your preferred asset
allocation on January 1 each year. </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Roth /
HSA</span></u></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal> RPS assumes that H.S.A. and Roth money will be the last accounts
to be withdrawn - and all money can be used tax free.   For your H.S.A, the
assumption is medical expenses incurred will be greater than the amount
withdrawn from your H.S.A.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Excess
RMD</span></u></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Required minimum distribution from your IRA may exceed your
total need (Budget + Taxes – social security and pensions).  In this case, RPS
simulation assumes that excess money will be deposited into your brokerage
account.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Budget
Adjustments When 1 Dies</span></u></b> </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>When testing a scenario where one person dies before the
other, RPS will automatically reduce the budget 25%.  It assumed that when one
person dies, budget needs are 25% lower.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Taxes</span></u></b>
</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS calculates estimated federal taxes using simple standard
deduction assumption. The reason RPS calculates taxes is to help with comparing
different retirement scenarios such as the benefits of taking social security
at various ages, and benefits of doing a Roth conversation early in retirement.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>RPS only assumes 1 (filing single) or 2 exemptions (married
filing joint).  No other options are provided.     </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Tax implications for employment wages is not considered.  RPS
does not consider itemized deductions, alternative minimum tax, or any credits
you may receive.  It also does not consider self-employment tax, employment
taxes or other taxes that may impact your true final federal tax.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Federal Taxes are calculated and combined in with the
following year budget.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Brokerage account gains are assumed to be long-term and
taxed at the capital gains tax rate.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Calculations for married filing jointly and single filing
options are provided.  Head of household and married filed separately are not
included.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>State income taxes are not calculated.    </p>

<p class=MsoNormal><b><u><span style='font-size:14.0pt;line-height:107%'>Social
Security Taxable</span></u></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal> RPS uses the process defined IRS Publication 915 for
calculating Social Security Taxable Amount.  Social Security benefit amount
will be federally taxable up to 85% of the benefit amount.  </p>
