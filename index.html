<p> Welcome to Retirement Plan Simulator!</p>

<p> The purpose of Retirement Plan Simulator (RPS) is to pressure test the survivability of financial plans for retirement by running the following simulations:</p>

<p> <ul> <li style="font-size:20px">Base Simulation: RPS will simulate your retirement plan against a simple smooth annual return rates for stocks and bonds, and adjust spending using constant inflation rate. </li>
<p>
<li style="font-size:20px">Historical Simulation: RPS will simulate your retirement plan against actual prior historical market performance and sequence of events.  Annual return rates of the S&P500 index (or total stock market index when available), intermediate bond fund index and inflation rates are used in the simulation.</li></ul>

<p> RPS cannot definitively tell if a plan will survive retirement, but it can show the possible range of results that could be experienced during retirement.  If a plan can survive every sequence of events in history (even the worst-case sequence of events), there is an excellent chance your plan will survive future scenarios.  Conversely, and maybe more importantly, if a plan survives only a small percentage of historical sequence of events, this may suggest you need to adjust your plan.  </p>
